Open Unreal,
Attach Tracker to an Actor that will add or subtract sanity,
Attach System to an Actor that can move around,
Set preferred sanity in blueprint on trackers,
Watch sanity go up and down

ps. Couldn't set up sanity bar properly, Did change all functions to UFunctions so they are visible in blueprint and useable.
White blocks are meant to be sanity blocks that can add or subtract sanity.
